For the basic usage introduction we will be installing `pendulum`, a datetime library.
If you have not yet installed Poetry, refer to the [Introduction]({{< relref "docs" >}} "Introduction") chapter.

First, let's create our new project, let's call it `poetry-demo`:
@y

その名前を `poetry-demo` とします。
@z

@x
This will create the `poetry-demo` directory with the following content:
@y
これにより `poetry-demo` ディレクトリが生成され、中身は以下のようになります。

@x
The `pyproject.toml` file is what is the most important here. This will orchestrate
your project and its dependencies. For now, it looks like this:
@y
`pyproject.toml` というファイルが、ここでは最も重要なものです。
これはこのプロジェクトと依存パッケージをコントロールします。
中身は以下のようになっています。

% snip code...

@x
Poetry assumes your package contains a package with the same name as `tool.poetry.name` located in the root of your
project. If this is not the case, populate [`tool.poetry.packages`]({{< relref "pyproject#packages" >}}) to specify
your packages and their locations.
@y
Poetry によって構成するパッケージは、`tool.poetry.name` に定められるパッケージがあたかも同一名称として含まれているかのように取り扱います。
そのパッケージはプロジェクトのルートディレクトリに存在するものとします。
このような取り扱いとは異なる方法を取りたい場合は、[`tool.poetry.packages`]({{< relref "pyproject#packages" >}}) においてそのパッケージ名とディレクトリを定めることが必要となります。
@z

@x
Similarly, the traditional `MANIFEST.in` file is replaced by the `tool.poetry.readme`, `tool.poetry.include`, and
`tool.poetry.exclude` sections. `tool.poetry.exclude` is additionally implicitly populated by your `.gitignore`. For
full documentation on the project format, see the [pyproject section]({{< relref "pyproject" >}}) of the documentation.

Poetry will require you to explicitly specify what versions of Python you intend to support, and its universal locking
will guarantee that your project is installable (and all dependencies claim support for) all supported Python versions.
Again, it's important to remember that -- unlike other dependencies -- setting a Python version is merely specifying which versions of Python you intend to support.

When you run `poetry install`, you must have access to some version of a Python interpreter that satisfies this constraint available on your system.
Poetry will not install a Python interpreter for you.
If you use a tool like `pyenv`, you can use the experimental configuration value [`virtualenvs.prefer-active-python`]({{< relref "configuration/#virtualenvsprefer-active-python-experimental" >}}).

@x
Poetry can be operated in two different modes. The default mode is the **package mode**, which is the right mode
if you want to package your project into an sdist or a wheel and perhaps publish it to a package index.
In this mode, some metadata such as `name` and `version`, which are required for packaging, are mandatory.
Further, the project itself will be installed in editable mode when running `poetry install`.

Therefore, it is not possible to build a distribution or publish the project to a package index.
Further, when running `poetry install`, Poetry does not try to install the project itself,
but only its dependencies (same as `poetry install --no-root`).

By default, Poetry creates a virtual environment in `{cache-dir}/virtualenvs`.
You can change the [`cache-dir`]({{< relref "configuration#cache-dir" >}} "cache-dir configuration documentation") value
by editing the Poetry configuration.
Additionally, you can use the
[`virtualenvs.in-project`]({{< relref "configuration#virtualenvsin-project" >}}) configuration variable to create
virtual environments within your project directory.

Child processes inherit their environment from their parents, but do not share
them. As such, any modifications made by a child process is not persisted after
the child process exits. A Python application (Poetry), being a child process,
cannot modify the environment of the shell that it has been called from such
that an activated virtual environment remains active after the Poetry command
has completed execution.

Alternatively, to avoid creating a new shell, you can manually activate the
virtual environment by running `source {path_to_venv}/bin/activate` (`{path_to_venv}\Scripts\activate.ps1` in PowerShell).
To get the path to your virtual environment run `poetry env info --path`.
You can also combine these into a one-liner, such as `source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate`
(`& ((poetry env info --path) + "\Scripts\activate.ps1")` in Powershell).

This brings us to the second scenario. If there is already a `poetry.lock` file as well as a `pyproject.toml` file

Either way, running `install` when a `poetry.lock` file is present resolves and installs all dependencies that you listed in `pyproject.toml`,
but Poetry uses the exact versions listed in `poetry.lock` to ensure that the package versions are consistent for everyone working on your project.
As a result you will have all dependencies requested by your `pyproject.toml` file,
but they may not all be at the very latest available versions
(some dependencies listed in the `poetry.lock` file may have released newer versions since the file was created).
This is by design, it ensures that your project does not break because of unexpected changes in dependencies.

Your CI server, production machines, other developers in your team,
everything and everyone runs on the same dependencies,
which mitigates the potential for bugs affecting only some parts of the deployments.
Even if you develop alone, in six months when reinstalling the project you can feel confident
the dependencies installed are still working even if your dependencies released many new versions since then.

A simple way to avoid such a scenario is to omit the `poetry.lock` file. However, by doing so, you sacrifice reproducibility and performance to a certain extent. Without a lockfile, it can be difficult to find the reason for failing tests, because in addition to obvious code changes an unnoticed library update might be the culprit. Further, Poetry will have to lock before installing a dependency if `poetry.lock` has been omitted. Depending on the number of dependencies, locking may take a significant amount of time.

As mentioned above, the `poetry.lock` file prevents you from automatically getting the latest versions
of your dependencies.
To update to the latest versions, use the `update` command.
This will fetch the latest matching versions (according to your `pyproject.toml` file)
and update the lock file with the new versions.
(This is equivalent to deleting the `poetry.lock` file and running `install` again.)
